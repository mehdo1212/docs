This is the main interface  of the panel. You can see on the left multiple buttons such as the shop, the servers area, the account area, the search button, and the logout button. (The "settings" button is reserved for admins).

Clicking on the shop, we see three menus: the server creation one, the ressource buying one and the credits buying one (not supported yet). To make a server, you simply go to the create menu and you fill out the form accordingly.

To buy additionnal ressources for your server, you need to invite/boost the server, and then we give you extra credits that can be used to buy ressources.

## 📂 Server Management Tabs

Inside a specific server, you get multiple tabs:

- **Console** – Real-time logs & input/output
- **File Manager** – Edit, upload, or delete server files
- **Databases** – MySQL databases with auto-creation support
- **Schedules** – Automate restarts, backups, etc.
- **Backups** – Manual or scheduled backups (if enabled)
- **Users** – Add sub-users with restricted permissions
- **Network** – View port allocations
- **Startup** – Modify environment variables (startup flags)
- **Settings** – Rename or delete the server

## 💬 Helpful Tips

- **Use backups** before major changes
- **Enable 2FA** for extra security
- **Use sub-users** instead of sharing passwords
- **Check the console** for errors — most problems show up there
