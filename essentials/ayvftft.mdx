Many of our VPS offerings come with **IPv6-only** connectivity. While that‚Äôs perfect for modern systems, some apps or game servers still rely on **IPv4 and port forwarding**. Here‚Äôs how you can work around that using a free tunnel service built by the community.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installing the Tunnel Service

To get started, simply run this one-liner on your VPS:

```
apt update && apt install -y git && git clone https://github.com/nahmolol/tunnel && chmod +x tunnel/tunnel && mv tunnel/tunnel /usr/local/bin/ && rm -rf tunnel && clear && echo "Tunnel installed successfully! Run it with 'tunnel'"
```

### ‚ûï Creating a Port Forward

Once installed, you can forward a port using:

```
tunnel make 80 
```

This will:

- Assign a **URL \+ port** you can share with others.
- Automatically forward requests to your VPS‚Äôs local port 80.

You can forward any port your app needs ‚Äî for example:

```
tunnel make 443  # for HTTPS 
tunnel make 25565  # for Minecraft 
tunnel make 8080  # for web services
```

### üí° Use Cases

- **Pterodactyl panel or wings** on IPv6-only nodes
- **Web servers** (NGINX, Apache)
- **Game servers** needing external access
- **APIs or bots** requiring public endpoints

### üîí Security Tip

If you're exposing a public-facing service, always:

- Enable firewalls (like `ufw`)
- Use SSL (Let's Encrypt or Cloudflare)
- Avoid exposing admin panels or SSH on forwarded ports unless protected
