Getting your own VPS in HighTPS (or Void Nodes) has never been easier than today, where we've developped a Discord bot to fully automate the progress, and today we'll be showing you how to get your very first HighTPS VPS\!

### 1. Inviting people/boosting the server

To get a VPS in either Void Nodes or HighTPS, you must invite people to the server or you can just boost the server. 

### 2. Creating an account in the panel

In HighTPS, it can be simply done using the /createuser command, but in Void Nodes you have to open a ticket to make an account.

### 3. Creating the VPS

Once you made your account, go to the commands channel and run the /create command.

After running the command, an admin will verify if you boosted or invited the correct number of people, and they will either accept the request or deny it.

And voil√†\! You just made your very first VPS, and it has never been easy than ever\!

Now head over to https://vm.hightps.pro or https://vm.voidhost.pro (Void Nodes' panel), log in with the credentials sent to you by the bot in DMs, and you will see your VPS there.
